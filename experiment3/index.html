				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Overworld Map:

					Generated using Perlin noise to create natural terrain with snow, lakes, and forests.
					
					Special elements such as houses and treasures were intelligently placed on valid ground tiles.
					
					Water edges were blended using auto-tiling for visual polish.
					
					Dungeon Map:
					
					Generated using structured logic that places non-overlapping, spaced rooms.
					
					Rooms are connected with L-shaped corridors to ensure navigability.
					
					Interactive elements like totems and treasures were placed only on valid open floor spaces, avoiding corners and tight corridors.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Dual World System: I can toggle between an animated overworld and a grid-based dungeon.
					Visual Consistency: Both maps use the same tileset but different logic for generation.
					Entity Rules:
					Treasures and totems (T, O) are only placed on open floor areas.
					Houses and treasures in the world appear only on valid terrain.
					Edge Drawing: Water transitions in the world use tile-based auto-tiling based on adjacent types.
					I use noise to generate the Grid, It ensures that a continuous block of graphics is generated for the lake surface. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I contributed and learn the code about, Implementing a tile-based overworld generator using Perlin noise.
					Designing and coding a custom dungeon generator that places rooms, enforces spacing, and connects them with corridors.
					Writing logic for intelligent placement of interactive elements (treasures and totems) that considers spatial context.
					Adding UI functionality for toggling between worlds, which enabled seamless visual switching between map types.</p>
