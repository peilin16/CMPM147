				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In World 3, the world is organized into staggered vertical columns that alternate between light yellow, light orange, and blank areas (simulating the background). Each tile gradually grows and shrinks, creating a "breathing" visual effect throughout the scene. Clicking a tile places a permanent Lumia sprite that stays put even if the world key changes.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>World 3 introduces a modulo-based staggered system where columns are assigned roles based on (i % 3). Columns alternate between light yellow, light orange, and a white background (no tiles drawn). Each active tile scales up and down individually using a local sine wave animation, with the timing slightly offset based on the tile position, creating a breathing effect across the grid. Clicking a tile places a persistent Rumia image that remains tied to that tile regardless of keystrokes.
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					For World 3, I made column-based staggered shading, independent breathing animations, and a persistent Rumia placement mechanic. The low point was making sure the timing of the tile scaling animations was accurate and didn't cause visual glitches. The variation in World 3's space comes from alternating yellow and orange columns, creating a rhythmic change as you scroll. The change in tonality controls which tiles turn yellow or orange after the world resets. Signs of life are achieved through breathing scaling effects and placing living Rumia sprites on tiles.</p>
